A small tetris clone written in C for the purpose of prototyping the game for an 8-bit Atmel AVR microcontroller. The game is displayed on a 8 x 16 LED matrix, so each square represents one light. Input will consist of three phsyical buttons: move left, move right and rotate. The score is displayed as a binary digit on the top of the screen to save space. 

The program was written using the allegro game library (www.liballeg.org) for graphics and user input.
